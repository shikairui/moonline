# Moonline
* By Raymond Shi
* Graphic Design, Period 1/Semester 2

Moonline is the title of my Graphic Design Course Project Final. I chose to create a [website](https://proud-alligator.cloudvent.net/) built around a product marketed toward businesses (cybersecurity and network optimization). 
I built this project initially completely from scratch by coding mainly in HTML using my own knowledge and expertise while also learning and solving problems in the process.
I started this project using Adobe Dreamweaver, I used Github Pages for online hosting and version tracking, and Jekyll for the theme.

Thank you Mrs. Rosensteel, for teaching this class. It's been an illuminating experience.
